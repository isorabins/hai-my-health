\
3/11/24\
\
## Accomplishments to Date:\
\
1. **Project Initialization**\
   - Created a new Python virtual environment named `new_hai`.\
   - Set up a new GitHub repository and synced it with local development using Git CLI.\
   - Initialized the project directory structure with folders for `docs`, `src`, and `tests`.\
\
2. **Telegram Bot Setup**\
   - Registered a new bot on Telegram via BotFather and retrieved the API token.\
   - Installed the `python-telegram-bot` library to interact with the Telegram API.\
   - Installed `python-dotenv` for environment variable management.\
\
3. **Basic Bot Functionality**\
   - Created `main.py` within the `src` directory as the entry point for the bot.\
   - Implemented a basic `/start` command for the bot to greet users.\
   - Set up an environment variable `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` to securely store the API token.\
   - Ensured sensitive files like `.env` are listed in `.gitignore` to prevent them from being pushed to GitHub.\
\
4. **Code Management**\
   - Used Git for version control, committing changes with meaningful messages.\
   - Familiarized with VSCode's source control features, with fallback to the Git CLI.\
\
## Next Steps:\
\
1. **Expand Bot Commands**\
   - Implement additional bot commands (`/help`, `/checkin`, etc.).\
   - Develop a system for the bot to handle more complex interactions, possibly with `ConversationHandler`.\
\
2. **Data Storage**\
   - Decide on a database system (e.g., SQLite for simplicity, PostgreSQL for robustness) for storing user data.\
   - Create models and schemas for the required data.\
   - Implement data persistence for bot conversations and user data.\
\
3. **Implement Health Data Tracking**\
   - Develop functionality for daily health check-ins and trend analysis.\
   - Enable the bot to ask users about their symptoms, mood, activities, and diet.\
   - Store responses for later retrieval and analysis.\
\
4. **Periodic Notifications and Reporting**\
   - Set up a job queue to send periodic reminders and health reports to users.\
\
5. **Testing and Quality Assurance**\
   - Write unit tests for individual bot functionalities.\
   - Create integration tests to simulate user interactions with the bot.\
\
6. **Documentation**\
   - Document the bot's features, usage instructions, setup process, and contribution guidelines in the `docs` folder.\
\
7. **User Feedback**\
   - Deploy a minimum viable product (MVP) to a small group of test users.\
   - Collect feedback and iterate on the bot features based on user input.\
\
8. **Deployment**\
   - Prepare for deployment to a cloud platform for continuous uptime.\
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline if necessary for automated testing and deployment.\
\
9. **Continuous Development**\
   - Continue developing features, refining the bot based on user feedback.\
   - Keep the documentation updated as the project evolves.\
\
## Additional Considerations:\
\
- **Security:** Ensure all user data is handled securely and complies with privacy laws.\
- **Scalability:** Design the bot's architecture to handle an increasing number of users as the project grows.\
- **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Establish a system for monitoring the bot's health and uptime and for performing regular maintenance.\
