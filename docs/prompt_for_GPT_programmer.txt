I'm developing 'Hai' the Health Coach, an AI-powered symptom tracker using a Telegram bot as the interface. The goal is not diagnostic but to track user health data, identify trends, and email weekly insights. I've outlined a project plan, initial interview questions, and a daily follow-up script. Could you review these documents for completeness and suggest enhancements? Also, are there additional features or UX considerations I should incorporate into the project plan?
