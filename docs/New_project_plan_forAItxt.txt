# "Hai" the Health Coach - Project Overview

## Introduction
"Hai" the Health Coach is an AI-powered health tracking system that uses a Telegram bot for user interaction. The system is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for tracking and analyzing health data, with a focus on user experience and data privacy.

## Software Stack and Technologies

- **Frontend:** 
  - Telegram Bot Interface for user interaction.

- **Backend:** 
  - Python for logic and data processing.

- **Database:** 
  - MongoDB for storing user data and responses, known for its flexibility with unstructured data.

- **NLP Libraries:** 
  - NLTK and spaCy for natural language processing to enhance the bot's ability to analyze user inputs.

- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** 
  - Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual insights in weekly email summaries.

## Key Features and Implementation Plan

- **Initial Setup:**
  - Develop the Telegram bot interface for user interactions and integrate with the Python backend processes.

- **User Onboarding:**
  - Conduct initial interviews using dynamic questioning to establish baseline health data.

- **Daily Follow-ups:**
  - Employ structured and open-ended questions to track health, leveraging NLP for response analysis.

- **Data Privacy and Security:**
  - Ensure end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest, compliance with data protection laws, and strict access controls.

- **Weekly Summaries:**
  - Perform data analysis to find correlations and insights. Create visual representations for personalized email summaries.

- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Introduce a user feedback mechanism to enhance the AI's accuracy and relevance.

- **Consensus Check System:**
  - Implement a double-check on data analysis using two independent models before sending weekly summaries.
