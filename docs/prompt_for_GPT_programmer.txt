I'm developing 'Hai' the Health Coach, an AI-powered symptom tracker using a Telegram bot as the interface. The goal is not diagnostic but to track user health data, identify trends, and email weekly insights. I've outlined a project plan, initial interview questions, and a daily follow-up script. Ive built out some code, which is attached here as a .py file, have a project roadmap also attached, and a project status here. I want to use crewai to create the agents for this project, but am having some issues, can you read through the examples and the documentation and help me out?
